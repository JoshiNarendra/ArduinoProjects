delayedReward.ino is an Arduino script to run behavior experiments with mice.

the basic idea is to present a stimulus (an odor in our case) to a mouse, wait a short amount of time,
and then deliver a reward. We are interested in seeing whether the mouse learns to associate the stumulus
with the reward despite the time delay. We monitor behavioral responses to the stimulus, specifically licking behavior.
