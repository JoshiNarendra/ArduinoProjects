1. First load the Arduino sketch named RotaryDisc.ino

2. Then open the GUI window named disc_GUI.py
	>  Here, set the given parameters as needed. Once you hit start,
	the program will start saving the collected data in a text file
	in the current folder (the folder where RotaryDisc.ino and disc_GUI.py
	are located.

3. arduinoCommunications.py sends and receives data between the computer and the Arduino

4. lickport.cpp and parameter_definitions.h are supporting files for the lick port to
   work properly with the Arduino. You won't need to make any changes here as long as
   the lick port is working fine.

Best wishes !!
